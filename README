With Sybase, when you try running a procedure via Hibernate, you get the following error...

13:15:40,818 DEBUG SQL:401 - { call pqbGetRoundPwb(?,?,?,?) }
Hibernate: { call pqbGetRoundPwb(?,?,?,?) }
13:15:40,881  WARN JDBCExceptionReporter:77 - SQL Error: 7713, SQLState: ZZZZZ
13:15:40,881 ERROR JDBCExceptionReporter:78 - Stored procedure 'pqbGetRoundPwb' may be run only in unchained transaction mode. The 'SET CHAINED OFF' command will cause the current session to use unchained transaction mode.


With 'anymode', the new error is this...

The 'CREATE TABLE' command is not allowed within a multi-statement transaction in the 'tempdb' database.


TODO:
=====
Investigate why that is the case, and explore you options

CHANGES
=======
1) Change procedures to execute in 'anymode'

EXEC sp_procxmode <procedure name>,'anymode'
go

2) Tell DBA's to change the 'ddl in tran' option to true for that database!

sp_dboption <database_name>,"ddl in tran", true

OBSERVATIONS
============
Going via spring works to execute stored proc without 'multi-statement tx' error message, but doing
it directly via Hibernate is causing issues!

The long and short of the story...

I too am having the problem. 

Yes ... this is a Sybase issue in a sense. 

The reason is that, when hibernate ... or in this case, JConnect JDBC goes off to find the columns of the table, it calls the stored procedure sp_jdbc_columns. 

The problem here is, that procedure creates a temporary table in tempdb, ... and the JDBC connection is set to autocommit=false by default ... and you cannot have "create table" commands while in the "middle" of a database transaction. 

The only way to call these metadata stored procedures is to have autocommit set to true. 

Is there anyway we can have this set to true only when calling the stored procs ?? ... and then return to autocommit = false ?? 

Anyone else have a better idea / solution ??
